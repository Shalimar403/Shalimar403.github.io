      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Howdy, I'm Chinmay Srivastava, an undergraduate student at The University of Texas at Dallas studying Computer Information Systems and Technology. In addition to my university studies, I work part-time at Code Wiz, a franchised learning institution, as their Lead Programming Instructor. I spend most of my time training new instructors, teaching children the basics of programming in various languages, and maintaining our Windows and Linux systems. Apart from my coursework in Computer Science and Information Technology, I'm a part of the Computer Security Group, a campus organization focused on penetration testing and cybersecurity. I've been competing in CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges, learning the basics of Web Exploitation, OSINT (Open-source intelligence), Cryptography, and much more. I spend my free time learning about various topics in cybersecurity and information technology, as well as studying for certifications in these fields. My future career goals are to secure a position in the cybersecurity or information technology industry and potentially pursue a master's degree in Information Technology.</p>
